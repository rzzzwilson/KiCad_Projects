SquareGen
=========

This project is a repackaging of the fast risetime Square Wave generator
that I built from the 
`video by W2AEW on YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cP6w2odGUc>`_.
I originally put this circuit into an enclosure using the "dead bug" style
and it worked pretty well.  Here's the built circuit:

And here's the circuit running on the 'scope:

Not bad for a cheap little circuit.  This shows a risetime of 2.7 nanoseconds.
The ringing has a frequency of about 130MHz.  Here the generator is working
into a 50Ω load and the peak-to-peak voltage is just over 2.5v.
It draws just under 30mA.

I have been building circuits on PCB lately using the PCB shops in China with
through-hole components, but now I want to get into surface-mounted components
so I'm using this circuit as a guinea-pig.  Using KiCAD here's the schematic:

and the PCB itself:

I'll put the PCB into the same 25x25x50mm enclosure as the first circuit, so the
PCB measures about 44x23mm.  I got the enclosures 
`from here <https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20180825211723&SearchText=50x25x25mm+Extruded+Aluminum>`_.

===============

The SMD PCB is back from China and the circuit has been built.  Here is the
assembled board being tested:

and the board installed in a small 25x25x50mm case:

With the generator working into a 50 ohm load it draws about 30mA at 5v.  Here's
a close look at the leading edge of the 3KHz square wave.  Risetime is even
better than the first version at 1.7ns.  Not shown is a 700KHz low frequency
ringing.

Next version
============

The SMD version above works very well, but there are a few things that could be
improved, such as:

* thicker connections on the output side,
* 50 ohm connections to the output pad,
* better power/RF connection pads,
* use a groundplane on the back side of the board.

The board is sized to fit into the 25x25x50mm case *diagonally* which will allow
much shorter connections for power and signal.  Here's the PCB:

===============

The PCB shown above has arrived and has been built.  Performance is slightly
better than the previous version.  Everything else is about the same, but the
leading edge risetime is now 1.6ns.

The only improvement I want to try is to add a 10uF decoupling capacitor to
the power input trace.  Testing it out by patching the board saw no change apart
from removing the 700KHz low frequency ringing.  Still, it's worth doing and
the latest KiCad design includes the capacitor.  I won't make a PCB for this
as the patched version works fine.  The final PCB looks like this:

Here's a shot of the "patched" board in its case:

That's about as far I will go with this simple circuit.
