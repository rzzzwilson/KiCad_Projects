This is a simple circuit to provide reverse polarity protection to any circuit
I build.  The idea came from
`NoGSG via the ARRL <http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/HandsOnRadio/Thoughts%20on%20Reverse%20Power%20Protection%20using%20Power%20MOSFETs%20-%20Wheeler%20N0GSG.pdf>`_
and the SuperCon presentation by
`Chris Gammel <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrRr4Iq6_M>`_.
