What is this?
=============

*HeadlessVFO* is a near-clone of the
`DDS-60 <http://midnightdesignsolutions.com/dds60/>`_
from `Midnight Design Solutions <http://midnightdesignsolutions.com/>`_
with an embedded microcontroller.  The aim is to produce a black box like
the DigitalVFO project but without the display and rotary encoder.

The features desired are::

* RF output, 2 volts peak-to-peak, with a frequency between 1 and 60 MHz
* Powered from the USB connection
* Controlled by an external computer via the USB connection

Design Documents
----------------

The *Misc* directory contains various documents:

* DDS-60_Schematic_A5.pdf - the DDS-60 schematic from Midnight Design Solutions
* Iota_schematic.pdf - the Iota schematic, the brains of HeadlessVFO

Status
------

Currently working on the schematic.  The VFO part is mostly done.
