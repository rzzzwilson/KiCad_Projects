What is this?
=============

*Iota* is a minimal clone of the `Arduino Micro <https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-micro>`_.
It is designed to be pin compatible with the Micro without some of its features,
particularly:

* power is via the USB C port only, there is no external power socket

The aim is to not just get a working Micro clone, but to ensure that my
knowledge of how to build something like a Micro is adequate.  Later the
Iota design will be embedded in designs such as the Headless VFO, a version
of DigitalVFO without the display and rotary encoder.
